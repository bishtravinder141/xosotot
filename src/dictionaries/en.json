      "rules": "What is a hash value?\n\nAnyone who knows the basics of Bitcoin will have been exposed to a concept, a hash value. Bitcoin's block header has a hash of the previous block that refers to the previous block.\n\nHash is the transliteration of Hash in English, we can also translate it into hash, so it is also called hash value. Hash value is a value calculated by a hash function (or hash function / hash algorithm). To understand hash values, it is necessary to understand the properties of a hash function. A hash function can computationally transform an input of arbitrary length into an output of length. fixed length.\n\nEach hash function has the following properties: If the input value is the same, the output hash value is the same, If the input value is different, the output hash value is usually different. But it is possible The possibility of a hash collision is extremely small. If during input there is a change, the hash collision will be resolved, then a completely unrelated hash value will be output. Because the hash function is immutable. and easy to verify, It is almost impossible to reverse the input value from the value from the output hash value. If there is an input value, the corresponding hash value can be verified immediately.\n\nTherefore, the hash value of each block is unique, random, unbreakable, unforgeable, the hash value of the block is automatically determined, and the record cannot be tampered with.\n\nHow many How many types of USDT?\n\n1. Omni-USDT is based on the Bitcoin network, the deposit address is the BTC address, deposits and withdrawals are through the BTC network;\n2. NOTE: If you bet small with a large number (or vice versa), it will be considered a violation of betting rules\n3. ERC20-USDT is based on the Ethereum ERC20 protocol, the deposit address is the ETH address, deposits and withdrawals are through the ETH network;\n4. TRC20-USDT is based on the TRON TRC20 protocol and the TRX (TRON) network, the deposit address is a TRON address, and deposits and withdrawals go through the TRON network.\n5. TrxHash is a block hash of TRC20-USDT based on the TRON TRC20 protocol and the TRX (TRON) network. The final number is used as the result to determine whether you won or not (click on Block Height to go to the public chain to query the unique Block hash)\n\nThe rules of the game are as follows:\n\n1. 1 prize draw every 1 minute, 55 seconds to bet, Cannot bet within the last 5 seconds.\n2. After closing, the block hash of the newly created block is used as the prize draw result.\n3. The total number of prize draws in a day is 1440.\n4. If you make a bet of 100, there will be a fee deduction of 2%, so your actual bet will be 98.\n5. 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes the game rules are the same as 1 minute, only the prize opening time is different.\n\nThe last digit of the hash value (Block hash) is used as the result\n\nExample:\nBlock hash value **b569 Prize drawing result is 9.\nBlock hash value **d14c Prize drawing result is 4.\nChoose green: If the result displays 1.3 ,7,9 you will get(98*2)=196; If the result shows 5, you will get (98*1.5)=147.\nChoose red: If the result shows 2,4,6,8, you will get (98*2)=196; If the result shows 0, you will get (98*1.5)=147.\nChoose purple: If the result shows 0 or 5, you will get (98*4.5)=441.\nChoose number: If the open result is the same as the result you selected, you will get (98*9)=882.\nChoose Big: If the result shows 5,6,7,8,9 you will get (98* 2)=196.\nChoose Small: If the result shows 0,1,2,3,4 you will get (98*2)=196."
